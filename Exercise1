Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are a major concern in lakes globally, with widespread ecological and socio-economic ramifications. Eutrophication exacerbates this unsightly algal growth, which is a process caused by nutrient influx from agricultural and urban runoff, leading to excessive algal biomass production and more algal cells in the water. HABs are getting worse with climate change in many places.

The ramifications of HABs extent beyond mere aesthetic problems. Cyanobacteria, prevalent in HABs, possess the capacity to synthesize potent toxins, such as microcystins and cyanotoxins. They pose significant threats to aquatic biota and human health. The decay of algal blooms contributes to oxygen depletion in water bodies, exacerbating hypoxia which is a phenomenon with far-reaching implications for aquatic life. Furthermore, toxins disrupt essential physiological processes and can cause severe adverse effects upon ingestion, skin contact, or inhalation.

Ecosystem impacts resulting from HABs are multifaceted and extensive. Beyond direct toxicity, the depletion of dissolved oxygen can lead to mass mortalities among fish and invertebrates, disrupting trophic dynamics and altering community structures. Aditionally, the release of toxins and nutrients during bloom degradation can induce benthic hypoxia and anoxia, further exacerbating adverse effects on sediment-dwelling organisms. Aquaculture operations, dependent on water quality, face substantial economic loses and regulatory challenges because HABs risk fish health and consumer safety. Moreover, recreational and potable water resources are compromised, posing risks to human health and necessitating costly treatment interventions. Effective HAB management strategies remain elusive.
